2015-12-29	1.3.2	- added inital ptouch-gtk - it is WITHOUT function
			  for now. I just have somewhere to start...

2015-11-12	1.3.1	- small bugfix
			- now using autotools

2015-02-13	1.3	- merged ptouch-printpng and ptouch-printtext to one
			  single tool so that multiple texts and images can be
			  printed in one single pass.
			- added ptouch_cutmark() function
			- added initial gettext() support

2015-01-05	1.2.3	- fixed a bug that did cut off chars which go below the
			  font baseline (like g,q,j,...)
			  Seems that gdImageStringFT() interprets the y coord
			  as baseline of the font (is this the case for all
			  fonts??) instead of the bottom most pixel.

2014-12-20	1.2.2	- added support for printing up to 4 lines of text

2014-11-01	1.2.1	- added support for PT-1230PC printer (not tested)

2014-10-1?	1.2	- added tool 'ptouch-printtext' which can print labels
			  with one or two lines of text

2014-10-11	1.1	- easier adding of (yet) unsupported p-touch printers
			  and tape widths
			- code cleanup

2014-10-08	1.0	Initial release
